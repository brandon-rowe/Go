# go
independent study of go lang

<p>
I will be uploading random projects from go lang.
I decided to start learning go because it has the capability of managing and keeping multiple connections at the same time.
Example use case would be a chat-room or blockchain transactions. It is also scalable to handle multiple users, accounts or processes.
